## Introduction

For my Capstone Project I decided to extend the work of Ryan Pickering’s project Ok Google: Residential Schools. His introduction is as follows.

The Indian residential school system is one of the most heinous parts of Canada’s history and is an ongoing injustice for Indigenous people across Canada. While a government apology and ongoing Truth and Reconciliation Commission have begun to heal the wounds that began over one hundred years ago, Canada still has a lot to answer for and reflect upon. When considering the attempted cultural genocide of Canadian Indigenous people throughout the 20th century through residential school, there is never a time to stop considering this.

This project grew out of a desire to discover how people were thinking about the residential schools in the last several years, with developments like Stephen Harper’s apology in 2008 and the ongoing Truth and Reconciliation Commission. I wanted to learn if Canadians were considering the legacy of residential schools or if it was being ignored in the everyday experiences of Canadians. I have not uncovered any objective answers, but what I have discovered is illuminating nonetheless.

Through analyzing search patterns on Google Trends about residential schools, I believe I have uncovered some interesting patterns and trends in how people use Google, the most prevalent search engine of the Internet, to look for knowledge about residential schools. By looking at when searching is going on, where it is happening, and how residential schools are being searched, I believe that I have discovered who is searching for residential schools primarily and why. Trends that seem both obvious and unusual are viewable, and indeed there are some trends that I am unable to understand, and hopefully another historian can discover further patterns and trends about residential schools and the general population.

The point of my extention of his project is to look at the trends up until today (his research finished in April 2015) and to futher anaylize them using the related topics and trends tool in Google Trends. The goal is in part to recreate Pickering’s findings and also allow for a deeper analysis of trends and topics around residential schools. The conclusion of this project will compare Pickering’s findings with my own to see if there are any similarities or differences. Also, to see if new trends have occured since April 2015 and what they might mean.

## Methodology

### Research

I plan on duplicating Ryan Pickering's results while also focusing on related topics and queries to see if there is anything of interest there. In terms of timeline, I plan on looking at his original timeline of January 2004 until April 2015, May 2015 until the present and then January 2004 until the present. I will be looking at the topics and queries in particular to see if anything stands out, if there are any major changes etc. I will also look at regions following the same format as above and again looking at topics and queries. I will include both provinces and cities.

I will also be eliminating the sematics seciton. While I did think in his presentation it was useful, since I will be focusing on the related topics and queries (and just after doing a quick look through) the terms he found in his semantics section are in the trends and queries. Therefore I will devote a whole section on examing those since his original section on semantics will also be included. 

### Comapring Conclusions

One of the goals is to compare the conclusion I make with the one Pickering made. I think that by looking at the topics and queries it will strenghten both conclusions and maybe point out some trends that have occured since the creation of his project.

## Timeline

*Pickering's Timeline (January 2004 - April 2015)*

Pickering's analysis of this period led him to the conclusion that it was mostly students that were researching about residential schools since many of the peak points in the graph are during the school year and numbers are much lower during school's summer and Christmas holiday. 

He also mentions that certain political events might have also spiked the search for residential schools. This includes former Prime Minister Stephen Harper's apology or the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). But even with that he concludes that these events fall generally still fall relative to the school year making it difficult to tell if there was even a spike at all.

Based on the most current searches, it can be argued that Pickering is correct and the trend does continue. There is a constant spike in searches at the start of the school year (around September in particular) and the search hits dip down when school is on Christmas and summer holiday. 

What I find more interesting is the comparison of related topics and queries. This is where real differences being to appear. Filtering the words by rising categories means that it is showing the topics and queries that had big jumps in the popularity of the search. The work breakout means that before this time there were little or no related searches or queries and now there are a lot. We will be focusing on the top 5 for both Pickering's timeline and mine.

Pickering's trends do point to confirming his assumption that Harper's apology and the TRC did play a role in a spike regarding the search for residential schools. The apology appears both in topics and queries making it seem to be one of the more popular related searches. The queries on the other hand appear to be more general about residential schools and many asking what they were.  

But examining the current trends allows us to see what topics have been more recently searched in relation to residential schools. In terms of topics, as suspected, Justin Trudeau is number one, possibly because he did place Indigenous issues high up on his agenda while serving as Prime Minister. Another interesting topic and query is Chanie Wenjack, Secret Path and Gordon Downie. These three are related as Gordon Downie brought the story of Chanie Wenjack back to life in a poem book called Secert Path. Orange Shirt Day is another new one. The trend of wearing an orange shirt on September 30th started in 2013 in hopes to create more awareness around residential schools. This could also be another reason why the term is searched for so much in September.

## Regions

In this section, I agree with Pickering's assumption that the reason that the three top provinces (Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta) to search residential schools is most probably because they have the highest amount of Indigenous people in those provinces. Even in my more recent timeline, the top three provinces are still the top three in the exact same order.
