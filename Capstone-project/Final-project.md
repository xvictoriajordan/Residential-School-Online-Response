## Introduction

For my Capstone Project I decided to extend the work of Ryan Pickering’s project Ok Google: Residential Schools. His introduction is as follows.

The Indian residential school system is one of the most heinous parts of Canada’s history and is an ongoing injustice for Indigenous people across Canada. While a government apology and ongoing Truth and Reconciliation Commission have begun to heal the wounds that began over one hundred years ago, Canada still has a lot to answer for and reflect upon. When considering the attempted cultural genocide of Canadian Indigenous people throughout the 20th century through residential school, there is never a time to stop considering this.

This project grew out of a desire to discover how people were thinking about the residential schools in the last several years, with developments like Stephen Harper’s apology in 2008 and the ongoing Truth and Reconciliation Commission. I wanted to learn if Canadians were considering the legacy of residential schools or if it was being ignored in the everyday experiences of Canadians. I have not uncovered any objective answers, but what I have discovered is illuminating nonetheless.

Through analyzing search patterns on Google Trends about residential schools, I believe I have uncovered some interesting patterns and trends in how people use Google, the most prevalent search engine of the Internet, to look for knowledge about residential schools. By looking at when searching is going on, where it is happening, and how residential schools are being searched, I believe that I have discovered who is searching for residential schools primarily and why. Trends that seem both obvious and unusual are viewable, and indeed there are some trends that I am unable to understand, and hopefully another historian can discover further patterns and trends about residential schools and the general population.

The point of my extention of his project is to look at the trends up until today (his research finished in April 2015) and to futher anaylize them using the related topics and trends tool in Google Trends. The goal is in part to recreate Pickering’s findings and also allow for a deeper analysis of trends and topics around residential schools. The conclusion of this project will compare Pickering’s findings with my own to see if there are any similarities or differences. Also, to see if new trends have occured since April 2015 and what they might mean.

## Methodology

### Research

I plan on duplicating Ryan Pickering's results while also focusing on related topics and queries to see if there is anything of interest there. In terms of timeline, I plan on looking at his original timeline of January 2004 until April 2015, May 2015 until the present and then January 2004 until the present. I will be looking at the topics and queries in particular to see if anything stands out, if there are any major changes etc. I will also look at regions following the same format as above and again looking at topics and queries. I will include both provinces and cities.

I will also be eliminating the sematics seciton. While I did think in his presentation it was useful, since I will be focusing on the related topics and queries (and just after doing a quick look through) the terms he found in his semantics section are in the trends and queries. Therefore I will devote a whole section on examing those since his original section on semantics will also be included. 

### Comapring Conclusions

One of the goals is to compare the conclusion I make with the one Pickering made. I think that by looking at the topics and queries it will strenghten both conclusions and maybe point out some trends that have occured since the creation of his project.
